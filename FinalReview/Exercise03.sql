-- QUESTION 1
-- YES, the order of the table declarations matters, because of the foreign key use,
-- if its not in the right order, need to do a (alter table xxx add foreign key(xxx) references xxx(xxx))

-- QUESTION 6
-- Add a constraint to the CREATE TABLE statements above to ensure that no employee can be committed for more than 100% of his/her time. Note that the SQL standard allows queries to be used in constraints, even though DBMSs don't implement this (for performance reasons).
