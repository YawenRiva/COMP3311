BCNF Normalisation

Algorithm:
	Res={R}
	while (any schema S in Res is not in BCNF) {
		choose an FD X->Y on S that violates BCNF
		Res = (Res-S) U (S-Y) U XY
	}
	forall FDs X->Y
	either (X->Y is trivial) or (X is a super key)
Example:
R = ABCDEFGH
FDs = ABH->C, A->DE, BGH->F, F->ADH, BH->GE
Key = ?
S/Res = {ABCDEFGH}

STEP 1:
	key = BH
	(look throught the FDS that LHS doesnt contain BH)
	Fix A->DE
	XY = ADE
	S-Y = ABCFGH (Res - RHS(DE))
	Res = {ADE, ABCFGH}

Res = {ABCFGH}
FDs = ABH->C, BGH->F, F->AH, BH->G

STEP 2:
	key = BH
	Fix F->AH
	XY = FAH
	S-Y = BCFG
	Res = {ADE, FAH, BCFG}

Res = {BCFG}
