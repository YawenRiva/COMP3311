   first which will require one dbquery() call.
   and for the 1000 goals, will call 500 times because
   $rr = dbQuery($db, mkSQL($count,$id));
   and there are only 500 avaliable players
   500 + 1 = 501 dbQuery() will be issued.

$player_goal = "select p.id, p.name, count(g.id) from players p
		left outer join goals g on (g.scoredby = p.id)
		group by p.id;";
$res = dbQuery($db, mkSQL($player_goal));
while ($t = dbNext($res)) {
	list($id,$name,$count) = $t;
	printf("%s %d\n", $name, $count);
}
